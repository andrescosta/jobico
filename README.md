# Jobico

## Introduction

Welcome to Jobico â€“ An Experimental, Non-Commercial, Multi-Tenancy Job Execution Platform!

Jobico is a project in the realm of experimental development with no commercial objectives. Specifically crafted for exploring job execution using WebAssembly (WASM) in a multi-tenancy environment, Jobico emphasizes flexibility and customization. It empowers tenants to define events, validate incoming data using JSON Schema, and execute custom programs written in any WASM-compatible language.

## Key Characteristics

- **Exploratory Nature**: Jobico is an exploratory project, offering a platform to delve into innovative approaches to job execution technologies.
- **Non-Commercial Objective**: Our primary goal is not commercial gain but rather fostering exploration and creativity in the realm of job execution and event processing.
- **Multi-Tenancy Focus**: Jobico is architected to support multi-tenancy, allowing for the simultaneous operation of multiple isolated tenants on the platform.
- **Event Definition with JSON Schema**: Tenants can define events by providing JSON Schema, enabling structured and dynamic event handling. Incoming requests are validated against the defined schema.
- **WASM-Compatible Language Support**: Tenants have the freedom to create custom programs in any WASM-compatible language, promoting flexibility and diversity in job execution.
