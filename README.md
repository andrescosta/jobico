## Components

### Listener
The **Listener** component serves as the entry point for external events, providing a REST API that functions as a webhook. Its primary responsibilities include receiving events, validating them against pre-defined JSON schemas, and subsequently enqueueing them for further processing. This component acts as the bridge between external sources triggering events and the internal processing pipeline.

### Queue
The **Queue** component acts as a chronological buffer for events, temporarily storing them until they can be processed by the Job Executors. Events are maintained in the queue in the order they are received, ensuring a sequential flow of processing. This component plays a crucial role in decoupling the event reception from the actual event processing, allowing for scalability and efficient handling of bursts of incoming events.

### Job Executors
**Job Executors** are responsible for consuming events from the Queue and providing a controlled environment for the execution of WebAssembly (WASM) programs that process these events. This component manages the execution context, ensuring isolation and security for running custom WASM programs written by tenants. It plays a key role in the dynamic and scalable execution of programmed jobs in response to events.

### Control Service
The **Control Service** is a centralized hub where Job definitions are stored and can be queried by other components in the system. It acts as the authoritative source for managing job configurations, allowing dynamic adjustments to the processing logic without interrupting the overall system operation. This service facilitates coordination and control over the execution of jobs across the entire platform.

### Job Repository
The **Job Repository** serves as a storage facility for WebAssembly (WASM) programs and JSON schema files. It provides a dedicated API for storing and retrieving these essential files, ensuring accessibility for the Job Executors and enabling tenants to manage their custom program logic efficiently. This component acts as a repository for the building blocks required for event processing.

### Executions Recorder
The **Executions Recorder** is a service designed to capture and store log information generated by the Job Executors during the execution of jobs. This component acts as a centralized logging system, allowing for post-execution analysis, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring. The recorded information can be queried using both the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Dashboard tools, providing visibility into the historical execution details of jobs.

### Command Line Tool
The **Command Line Tool** serves as the primary management interface, providing a comprehensive set of commands for tenants to interact with the Jobico platform. This tool empowers tenants to deploy job definitions, upload associated WASM and JSON schema files, and query the Executions Recorder for log information. Its command-line interface offers flexibility and efficiency in managing and overseeing job-related activities within the system.

### Dashboard
The **Dashboard** is a terminal-based application designed for visualizing Job definitions and execution information. Sporting a colorful and intuitive interface, the Dashboard provides a user-friendly experience for tenants to monitor and analyze the status of their jobs. It serves as a graphical representation of the Jobico platform, offering insights into the dynamic execution of jobs, the current state of the system, and facilitating quick decision-making through its visually appealing display. The Dashboard enhances the overall user experience by providing a vivid and informative overview of the platform's activity.

## Jobicolet

### What is a Jobicolet?

A **Jobicolet** is a specialized WebAssembly (WASM) program designed to process an event and generate a result within the Jobico platform. It represents the executable logic that is dynamically loaded and executed by the Job Executors when handling specific events. The term "Jobicolet" is coined by combining "Job" and "Wasm," emphasizing its role in executing jobs written in any WASM-supported programming language.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **WASM Execution:**
   - A Jobicolet is implemented as a WebAssembly module, allowing it to be written in any programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. This flexibility empowers users to express their event processing logic in a language of their choice.

2. **Event Processing:**
   - The primary function of a Jobicolet is to process events. It takes as input the event data, performs the specified logic defined within the WASM module, and produces a result based on the defined processing rules.

3. **Result Generation:**
   - Upon processing an event, a Jobicolet generates a result. The nature of the result depends on the specific logic implemented in the WASM module. It could be a computation outcome, a transformed dataset, or any other relevant output.

4. **Language Agnostic:**
   - Jobicolets are language-agnostic in the sense that they can be written in any programming language that supports compilation to WebAssembly. This feature provides developers with the freedom to choose a language that aligns with their expertise and the requirements of their event processing tasks.

### Workflow:

1. **Implementation:**
   - Developers implement a Jobicolet by writing the event processing logic in a programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. The code is encapsulated within a WebAssembly module.

2. **Compilation:**
   - The source code of the Jobicolet is then compiled to WebAssembly bytecode, creating a binary module that can be executed on any WebAssembly runtime.

3. **Deployment:**
   - The compiled Jobicolet is deployed within the Jobico platform, and its metadata, such as the module reference, is registered in the Job Repository.

4. **Execution:**
   - When an event occurs that triggers the associated job, the Job Executors retrieve the corresponding Jobicolet from the Job Repository and execute it in the designated runtime environment.

5. **Result Handling:**
   - The executed Jobicolet produces a result, which is then handled according to the specified result processing rules defined in the job configuration.

### Benefits:

- **Flexibility:**
  - The language-agnostic nature of Jobicolets provides developers with flexibility, allowing them to choose the most suitable programming language for expressing their event processing logic.

- **Scalability:**
  - As Jobicolets are executed within the scalable and isolated environment of Job Executors, the platform can efficiently scale to handle a large number of concurrent event processing tasks.

- **Interoperability:**
  - Jobicolets can interact with other components within the Jobico platform, facilitating seamless integration with queues, event definitions, and runtime environments.

A Jobicolet, at its core, represents the embodiment of programmable and scalable event processing within the Jobico platform, offering developers the freedom to innovate using the power of WebAssembly.
