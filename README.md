[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/andrescosta/jobico)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/andrescosta/jobico)

## Introduction

Welcome to Jobico â€“ An Experimental, Multi-Tenancy asynchronous computing Platform!

Jobico is a Go project designed for experimental development, with a focus on exploring asynchronous computing using WebAssembly (WASM) in a multi-tenancy environment. It prioritizes flexibility and customization, allowing tenants to define events, validate incoming data using JSON Schema, and execute custom programs in any WASM-compatible language.

## Key Characteristics

- **Exploratory Nature**: Jobico serves as an exploratory project, providing a platform for investigating different approaches to asynchronous computing technologies.

- **Multi-Tenancy Focus**: Jobico's architecture is specifically designed to facilitate multi-tenancy, enabling the simultaneous operation of multiple isolated tenants on the platform.

- **Event Definition with JSON Schema**: Tenants can define events through JSON Schema, allowing for structured and dynamic event handling. Incoming requests undergo validation against the specified schema.

- **WASM-Compatible Language Support**: Jobico offers support for custom program creation in any WASM-compatible language, fostering flexibility and diversity in the execution of jobs.

## Getting Started with Jobico

This guide provides instructions for compiling, starting, testing, and running [Project Name].

### Local Go Environment

If you have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your machine, you can compile Jobico directly from the source code:

``` bash
git clone 
cd jobico
make local
```

Alternatively, you can compile using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine):

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/andrescosta/jobico.git
cd jobico
make dckr_build
```
### Service Management

1. Windows

```powershell
scripts/startall.ps1
```
```powershell
scripts/stopall.ps1
```

2. Linux

```bash
scripts/startall.sh
```
```bash
scripts/stopall.sh
```

3. Docker

``` bash
make dckr_up
```
``` bash
make dckr_stop
```

### Running Tests with K6
After starting the platform locally, you can run a set of basic test cases using K6:

``` bash
make k6
cd perf
./k6.exe run events.js
```

And for a more comprensive set of test cases, run:

```bash
./k6.exe run eventsandstream.js
```
